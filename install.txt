OPERATING SYSTEM CONFIGURATION

To disable apport and enable core dump detection do the following:

1. Edit /etc/default/apport so that it reads
enabled=0
2. In /etc/sysctl.d create a new file named 60-core-pattern.conf with contents:
kernel.core_pattern = core
3. To apply the changes immediately run:
sudo sysctl --system

To prevent users from reading eachothers files, edit /etc/login.defs, find line
that says:
UMASK		022
and set it to:
UMASK		077


C9 INSTALLATION

1. Clone c9etf repository in a folder, e.g. /usr/local/webide. 

 $ cd /usr/local
 $ sudo git clone https://github.com/vljubovic/c9etf webide


2. Copy file lib/config.php.default to lib/config.php and edit it to your needs.
Defaults are just fine for test install.


3. Run install.php. This script will make various changes to your system:

 $ cd /usr/local/webide
 $ sudo php install.php


4. A user is created on your system named "c9" (or something else that you set in
config.php as $conf_c9_user). Now you need to run Cloud9 as this user and visit 
the web directly so that you could finish the install procedure.
 $ sudo su c9
 $ cd /home/c9/fork
 $ nodejs server.js -p 10000 -a : -l YOURIP -w /home/c9/workspace

Instead of YOURIP specify the IP address that you use to reach your server. If 
server started correctly, you can now open

 http://YOURIP:10000/

You will see a wizard for "Quickly setup Cloud9 on your workspace". This wizard 
can not be automated, you need to go through it manually. It configures a 
default workspace that will be copied to all the other users. Just click Next until
you see a window that informs you that Cloud9 is successfully installed and click
the button named Finish.

Now you can safely close the browser window, then interrupt nodejs process in console 
(just press Ctrl+C) and exit c9 user:

 ^C
 c9@server:~fork$ exit

 
5. After wizard is finished, there are still some configuration steps that need to
be done so that Cloud9 WebIDE would be accessible to users without issues. You need
to again run install.php with "continue" parameter that instructs the installation
script that you have already started Cloud9 installation and now wish to continue.

 $ cd /usr/local/webide
 $ sudo php install.php continue


6. Create a local user named 'admin' so you could access the admin web interface:

 $ /usr/local/webide/bin/webidectl add-local-user admin PASSWORD

Instead of PASSWORD insert the password that you wish to use. Create another local 
user so you can test the webide:

 $ /usr/local/webide/bin/webidectl add-local-user test PASSWORD


7. Visit webpage

http://yourhost/ (login as user "test").

http://yourhost/admin.php (login as user "admin")
